/**
 * A menu that draws its own structure: a trunk down the left of each group,
 * with a short elbow branching out to every row.
 *
 * Replaces grouping-by-whitespace. A heading plus a horizontal rule asks the
 * reader to infer that the rows below belong to the heading above; a drawn
 * branch states it. That matters most in the sidebar's overflow menu, which
 * is five groups deep and is the one place a user goes when they are already
 * unsure where something lives.
 *
 * Built from two dumb primitives rather than an `items={[...]}` prop so
 * callers keep full control of what a row is — the sidebar's rows carry a
 * badge and a pin toggle, and a data-driven API would need a slot for each.
 *
 * The lines are `aria-hidden` elements, not box-drawing characters. Drawn as
 * text they would land in the accessibility tree and in find-in-page, and
 * they would take the text colour rather than the border colour.
