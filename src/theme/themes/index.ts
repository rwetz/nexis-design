/**
 * Nexis-designed themes. Every one is generated from a single shared OKLCH
 * ramp (see `themes.contrast.test.ts` for the floors it guarantees), so the
 * set holds one contrast profile across sixteen hue families and both light
 * and dark. These are original palettes, not recolours of anything.
 *
 * Ordered quiet-first. The original six are muted, near-neutral surfaces with
 * one accent; the ten that follow turn the *surface* chroma up rather than
 * only the accent, which is what actually makes a theme loud — a saturated
 * background reads as a colour instead of as grey. They sit on the identical
 * ramp and clear the identical floors: vivid, not unreadable. The generator
 * refuses to emit a palette that drops below one, and it caught exactly that
 * while these were being cut.
