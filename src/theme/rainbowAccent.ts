/**
 * The rainbow hover accent for the Nexis Default theme.
 *
 * This module owns *what* gets a rainbow and *which* rainbow; `globals.css`
 * owns only how one is painted. The split matters because the interesting part
 * of the effect cannot be expressed in CSS at all: a button is meant to show a
 * different one of the four gradients on **every** hover, and CSS has no way to
 * advance a counter on a pointer event. So a single delegated listener stamps
 * the choice onto the element as custom properties, and the stylesheet has one
 * rule that reads them.
 *
 * Keeping the *scope* here too is what makes the effect tunable. The first cut
 * of this lived entirely in CSS, matched every `hover:bg-accent` /
 * `hover:bg-muted` utility in the tree, and consequently fired on every list
 * row, tree item and menu entry in the app — roughly 200 call sites. Narrowing
 * that from a stylesheet means guessing at selectors; narrowing it from here is
 * two predicates you can read.
 *
 * ## What gets one
 * A button — `<button>`, `[role="button"]`, `[role="tab"]`, or a real link —
 * **and** one whose hover state is the neutral highlight (`hover:bg-accent` /
 * `hover:bg-muted` and friends). The second half is the important one: it
 * excludes the primary, destructive and link button variants, whose hover is
 * already their own colour and carries meaning a rainbow would erase. Rows,
 * menu items (`[role="menuitem"]`), options and tree items are excluded by the
 * first half — they are the bulk of what made the first version too much.
 *
 * ## What never does
 * A control holding a file-type icon (`[data-file-icon]`: explorer rows, file
 * tabs, Spotlight results), and anything inside a tree or under
 * `[data-no-rainbow]`. File icons have their own colour scheme, which says
 * what kind of file it is; repainting it on hover erases the information.
 *
 * ## Glyph or text
 * A control with an SVG paints the **glyph** — even when it also has a label.
 * A text-only control paints its **text**. Its ordinary neutral hover surface
 * always stays in place, which keeps the spectrum as a small signal rather
 * than turning every eligible button into a billboard.
