/**
 * The single choke point for every UI icon in Nexis.
 *
 * Call sites name an icon *semantically* (`"close"`, `"refresh"`) rather than
 * naming a vendor's export (`Cancel01Icon`, `X`). Two things fall out of that,
 * and both are the reason this module exists:
 *
 * 1. **The icon vendor is an implementation detail.** Swapping Phosphor for
 *    something else is an edit to `REGISTRY` below, not a sweep over 100+
 *    files. The previous direct-import arrangement made the vendor part of the
 *    plugin API's public contract — `PanelContribution.icon` was typed as a
 *    Hugeicons object, so a plugin could not contribute a panel without
 *    depending on the same icon package Nexis happened to use that week.
 *
 * 2. **One concept renders as one glyph.** The direct-import era accumulated
 *    three different "refresh" icons, three "checkmark", four "edit", four
 *    "terminal", and two each for delete/copy/globe/database/layers/clock —
 *    160 imports expressing 136 ideas. A semantic key makes that collision
 *    impossible to reintroduce: there is one `"refresh"`, and it is one glyph.
 *
 * Enforced by `pitfall 18` in `src/lib/pitfall-guards.test.ts`, which fails the
 * build if any module outside this file imports the icon vendor directly.
 *
 * ## Size
 * Use the named scale. Before it existed, call sites picked from **13**
 * different pixel sizes (9–28) and **12** different stroke weights, which is
 * what made the UI read as assembled rather than designed. A raw number is
 * still accepted for the rare genuinely-bespoke case, but reach for `size`
 * first — if a new size is truly needed, add it to the scale.
 *
 * ## Weight
 * Phosphor ships six weights from one package, and Nexis uses that as a state
 * axis rather than decoration: `regular` is the resting state and `fill` marks
 * active/selected. Prefer `active` over passing `weight` by hand — it keeps the
 * idle→active pair consistent everywhere.
